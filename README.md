# Multiple-Linear-Regression-Analytics-Project

This is was a group project where we constructed statistical modelling using multiple linear regression. The project is displayed in a well-structured format and created using a Jupyter Notebook.

In this project, I can demonstrate various python skills such as working with Numpy, Pandas, MatPlotLib and similar python modules. Moreover, throughout this project, I have enhanced a deeper knowledge in various data analytic concepts like data preparation, outliers, univariate and multivariate data, linear regression, multiple linear regression, correlations, backwards and forward feature selection and diagnostic checking.
